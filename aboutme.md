title: About me

While the bulk of admins tend to focus on automating components of the Microsoft/365 ecosystems, or anything of cloud nature (and rightly so), I find it more challenging and fun to automate <em>anything</em> that can talk and/or listen.

Be it a customized Windows baseline tool, automating live streaming and archiving from start to finish on macOS, or dynamically generating and printing DYMO QR code labels of serial numbers for computer lab systems... it's all about identifying and understanding the need, and the fun of following through with a workable solution.

The purpose of this blog will not only help me in moments of, "...and what was I gonna do? It was about... oh yeah..." but to also assist others in finding a solution of their own or just some clarity on a topic.
